## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.8] - 2026-08-27

Initial public release. A single-file, stdlib-only terminal radio player that
drives `mpv` and adds optional AI enrichment for the now-playing track.

### Added

- Full-color `curses` TUI — one self-contained Python file, no pip dependencies.
- `mpv` as the audio engine, remote-controlled over an IPC socket: pause,
  volume, mute, reconnect, real stream metadata and elapsed time.
- Live icy-metadata parsing with mojibake repair and artist/title splitting;
  plays Venice Classic Radio by default or any stream URL.
- AI enrichment (fully opt-in, silent fallback): a trivia note about the work,
  a `Work:` line when the tag was only a movement/fragment, and a Wikipedia
  link — the article is verified to exist *and* match before it is ever shown.
- Three AI providers, switchable live with `1`/`2`/`3`:
  - **opencode** headless server (zero-auth gateway) — default in this build;
  - **ollama** — a local instance or one on your LAN (`localhost:11434` default);
  - **any OpenAI-compatible API** (Groq, OpenRouter, Gemini, NVIDIA NIM, …).
- Per-provider timing and ollama telemetry in the logs; the display shows the
  full trivia text, uncut.
- Persistence: `config.json` (provider + color theme), `cache.json`
  (enrichment cache tagged with the provider that produced it), `settings.json`
  (all AI settings self-contained; shell env vars still work as overrides).
- Instant dark/light palette toggle with `p`, remembered across sessions.
- `mradio --settings` prints the effective configuration (API keys masked).
- `install.sh` / `Makefile` installers and a `make check` syntax target.
